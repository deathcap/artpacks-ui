# artpacks-ui

A user interface for reordering and adding [artpacks](https://github.com/deathcap/artpacks)

![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/60PW8eB.png "Screenshot")

The list shows the currently loaded packs, which you can drag and drop
to reorganize the priority (when looking up artwork, the pack on top is
searched first, followed by the next pack, etc., until a pack with
the desired resource is found). The pack logo and description is shown,
if available.

New packs can be added by dropping a .zip file from disk. The above screenshot
shows three resource packs loaded:
[ProgrammerArt](https://github.com/deathcap/ProgrammerArt),
[Faithful32](https://github.com/smenes/Faithful32), and
[Sphax PureBDCraft](http://bdcraft.net/). For a usage example, run
`npm start` or try the [live demo](http://deathcap.github.io/artpacks-ui/).
